# bvm.spi
A terminal-based Relative SPI &amp; CPI Calculator built in C, modeled on my college, BVM Engineering College’s class-average grading system using Z-score normalization. This SPI calculator will allow you to estimate the approximate SPI for the semester. The calculator is only for Relative Grading systems.
